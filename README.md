### :running: Run Locally

#### Installing dependencies

```bash
  cd server
  npm install | yarn 
```

#### Start the server

```bash
   cd server
   npm start | yarn start
```

#### Run index.html file

Note: liveserver doesn't work in this case because it watch all folder inside both client and server. So we create a file inside server , it reloads the page. I would recommend you to open index.html file like the way below.

```
Find index.html file in you local file(home/desktop) and right click =>  open in browser
```
